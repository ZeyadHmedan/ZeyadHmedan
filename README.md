# Hi there  Iâ€™m @ZeyadHmedan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **junior React developer** with experience in building **responsive** and **dynamic** web applications using:
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript**

I also have hands-on experience with:
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering
- Third-party libraries like:
  - **Axios**
  - **React Query**
  - **Redux Toolkit**
  - **React Router** for state management and API handling

I'm always eager to learn new technologies

Let's connect and create something amazing! âœ¨
